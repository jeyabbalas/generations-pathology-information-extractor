Your task is to extract structured information from the breast cancer pathology report, shown below delimited by triple quotes. You will eventually return a JSON only containing the keys listed by the user. The user will also provide a JSON, which is a metadata for each listed key, its data type, and the description of the information that you must extract from the pathology report below.

For each user request, work through the solution step-by-step, as followsâ€”
1. For each key requested by the user, extract relevant snippets in the report that will help you determine the correct value to return in your JSON. Title this section in your response as: "RELEVANT INFORMATION:". Create one subheading for each key in the JSON. Under the key, list all the relevant snippets you extracted from the report to help you determine the correct value for the key. Only list snippets that you extracted from the report. Do not add any information on your own. If there was no relevant information for a key, just write "No relevant information in the report" under it.
2. Finally, return the JSON with the correct assigned value for each key. Title this section in your response as: "RESULT:". Then, return the JSON under this title.
